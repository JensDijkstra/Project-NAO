# NAO Design report

## Abstract

## Index

## Introduction

The urban upmarket healthclub **[name]** gives Tai Chi lessons. When performing Tai Chi it is important to be aware of your posture. During live classes a Sifu can correct individuals on their poses. At home however, there is nobody to check if you're doing everything correctly. 
A NAO robot by SolidBank is a great solution to this problem. NAO is able to move like a human and has the ability to provide live feedback to the user. 

GeekySolutions has been asked to design and program the NAO so it can act as a real Tai Chi Sifu. Not only will it be able to move like a human, it will also be programmed to have meaningful interactions with the user. These interactions could be grading and correcting the user's pose, give additional information about Tai Chi and interact with the user in a personal way. 
The idea is that students take a NAO home so after the live classes they can practice their pose correctly. This makes them progress much faster and more efficiently since the students still receive live feedback at home.  

  
The structure of this report is as follows. the first chapter all preparations are made

||| NAONAO is able to recognize pre-defined speech patterns.                                                   |   x   |          |       |
|             |      x     | NAO can have at least three different social conversations with the user.                                  |       |     x    |       |
|             |      x     | NAO confirms with the user if the exercise is clear.                                                       |   x   |          |       |
|      x      |            | Certain functions and conversations can be performed through a 3rd party speech recognition API.           |       |          |   x   |
|             |      x     | If the user does not interact with NAO for 30-60 seconds, it will ask if the user still needs its service. |   x   |          |       |
|             |      x     | Gegevens worden opgehaald. Wacht een paar seconden en knip of kopieer vervolgens opnieuw.                  |       |          |   x   |
|             |      x     | Users movements can be evaluated and then corrected by the NAO.                                            |       |     x    |       |
|             |      x     | NAO can remember and recognice the users face.                                                             |   x   |          |       |
|             |      x     | The vision software is able to measure the distance from the camera to the user.                           |       |     x    |       |
|             |      x     | NAO can demonstrate the postures of the Tai Chi 10-form.                                                   |   x   |          |       |
|      x      |            | Transitions between the postures are fluid                                                                 |       |     x    |       |
|             |      x     | When not performing the 10-form, the NAO looks at the user.                                                |   x   |          |
